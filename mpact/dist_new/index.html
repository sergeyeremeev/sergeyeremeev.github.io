                    We utilize strategically placed displays to reach consumers with highly targeted messages in venues
                    that include transportation hubs such as airports; executive networks in office-building lobbies and
                    elevators; networks in condominium buildings, shopping malls, fitness centers, medical clinics and
                    other locations. This provides a great marketing medium for Advertisers to target potential
                    clients/consumers! <br> Advertisers can customize their messages to a specific location, time of day,
                    or special event to increase the return on their marketing campaigns. The TV screens in our network are
                    located in high traffic areas which have custom static, semi-static and fully moving commercials/advertisements
                    for various local and national businesses.
