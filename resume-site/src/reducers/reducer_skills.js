        absolutely amazing. It is especially important to stay up-to-date with the most recent CSS features and trends
        as it might come handy not just when you create something beautiful but also when you are striving for the best
        performance. Animations, transitions, 3D effects can all give the website a modern look but it's also important
        to remember the performance implications. Be sure to expect absolutely the highest quality styles, whether it is 
        Sass, Scss, Styled-components, PostCSS or even plain CSS3`,

        otherwise you are not being efficient. It is especially important to understand the core JavaScript if you want 
        to call yourself a true Frontend developer. I know all the ins and outs of the language, have a fluent command 
        of both Vanilla and ES6+ JavaScript, and have an expert knowledge of React, Vue, Backbone, Knockout, jQuery, 
        Underscore and many other frameworks and libraries. To top it all off, I love solving coding challenges from
        various competitions using plain JavaScript and have written multiple tutorials on my personal blog.`,

        immediately and perform perfectly at 60 FPS. To achieve that a developer must know how to efficiently load
        resources, when to display assets, how to inline critical CSS and defer loading of non-critical assets.
        Furthermore it is essential to write efficient JavaScript which will not cause stuttering of the page. I have
        achieved 99-100 Google PageSpeed score in the past and I know exactly how to make anything run fast.`

        transitioning into a Full-stack developer. In the past two years I have finished over 10 individual projects
        which required extensive backend work. Apart from PHP, I have shown a lot of interest in Python and have been 
        using it in my personal projects and some coding challenges. Looking into other languages and other programming

        tool to quickly bootstrap a project and a powerful framework for creating truly complex web applications and 
        e-commerce solutions. Over 40 projects with custom themes launched, more than 20 of them are heavily customized 
        from backend with custom written frameworks/plugins for a highly customizable solution which can be easily 
        edited by any user with very little WordPress experience. Whether it's a small plugin or a large-scale trading

        can be an irreplaceable tool when it comes to compiling, minifying and optimizing your code. Modern
        Frontend development without build tools is like a restaurant without a stove. Every Frontend developer
        should be able to effortlessly write a configuration for at least one of the common build tools. It can be a
        simple Parcel/Rollup setup or a comples Webpack/Grunt/Gulp configuration - a modern developer must know it all.`,

        does it allow multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, it also makes the development process 
        easier and more structured via commit messages and also safeguards against accidental code losses. Applications
        like SourceTree or GitKraken can simplify developer's live but there is no excuse to not know all the important
        git commands and be able to efficiently use git within the terminal.`,

        better problem solving and creative thinking.`,

        developed to easily create tasks, track the progress, easily deploy code and keep all team members up-to-date
        with the overall progress. Employing Scrum is especially important in more complex team project as it can give
        a much clearer project overview for the manager/lead and make the deployment process much faster and simpler.
        Daily meetings, Kanban flow, Jira tracking, CI/CD - all of these contribute to an agile and efficient team.`,
